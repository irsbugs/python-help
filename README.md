# python-help

A Gtk GUI for the python help utility

Originally written to use GTK3, then upgraded to use GTK4. Both the GTK3 and the GTK4 python programs are provided.

These programs were presented at the Hamilton Python Users Group meeting on 8 Aug 2022. The slide show *python-help-presentation* describe the steps in writing the GUI application using GTK3. The slide show *gtk3-to-gtk4* describes the debugging and changes required to change the program to run using Gtk4.

The slide show presentations are in .odp and .pdf formats.
